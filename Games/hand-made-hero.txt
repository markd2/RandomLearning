Interesting:
  - 013 - user input from platform layer to game layer
  - 014 - single big allocation - permanent (frame-to-frame) and transient storage
  - 020 - gather input / update(render prep) / render / wait  flip
        - only partly watched (audio sync / write cursor)
  - 021 - dynamic loading of code DLLs - pretty cool
        - because all the memory and whatnot is given to the game, can reload
          all the game code and give it the memory.
  - 023 - kind of cool idea of recording events and playing them back (in 
          conjunction with the live code reloading)
          Also, the single allocated block being the entire savable game state
  - 024 & 025 - skipped - all windows platform layer stuff
  - 026 - game architecture (and urban planning analogy), unified update and render mode,
          "Loading Screen" vs "Streaming" for getting resources
  - 027 - concerete architecture talk.  Explore and then lock-in for the next
          point towards the destination. Also starting on the software renderer,
          fp coordinates for rectangles
