# Dungeon

Take the Normalizing example from Chapter 2 and try it OOPstyles
and DoDstyles.

Also to further confuse things, use Swift, and see if we can
figure out cache behavior between the two.

Idea is to take the dungeon, put stuff in it, draw it, maybe move
around it doing things, and see how easy/hard it is in the two
paradims, and also if we can infer anything with the differences
in data access patterns
