Picking samples from [DMP French house](https://www.dancemusicproduction.com/product/french-house/)
  - sample a short part that changes in pitch
  - ignore the bass, concentrae on the high frequency instruments
  - try to sample out of context of the original record
  - sample a little more than intended for the Stockhausen Effect
