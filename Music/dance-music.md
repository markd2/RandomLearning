# Stuff Gleaned from Videos

Questions when listening to stuff

  - was there a bass line?
  - if so what was it doing?  
      - Changing pitch?
      - offbeat?
      - real or synth?
      - how many pitches and did it change
  - what drums were there
      - kick, of course, what else?
      - snare? 
      - open/closed hat?
      - cymbal?
  - was there a melody?
    - what did it play?
    - constant tone or rise and fall
    - what instrument
  - hear any effects?
    - delay on anything?
    - reverb?
    - chorus?
    - filter?
  - how did the arrangement go?

Picking samples from [DMP French house](https://www.dancemusicproduction.com/product/french-house/)
  - sample a short part that changes in pitch
  - ignore the bass, concentrae on the high frequency instruments
  - try to sample out of context of the original record
  - sample a little more than intended for the Stockhausen Effect


### Transients

1176 compressor on a rock drum. The FET tends to clamp donw and
distort the transient, adds punch, and brings snare to the front
of the mix.

Transient engery can move the sound forward (or back) in the mix

### Reverb

Types and Uses

* Hall - adds height
  - large spaces, for long smooth decay
  - reflections farther apart
  - lower diffusion than room.
* Spring - adds character
  - "easy to hear" - manifestations of a vibrating spring
  - low diffusion, but a metallic bouncy texture
  - sounds flat, not 3-D sound
    - (sounds kind of weird)
* Room - adds depth
  - smaller rooms, living rooms. Short decay times and close reflections.
* Plate - adds width and dimension
  - a huge vibrating metal plate with contact microphones
  - always sound bright with metallic edge. And heavily diffused (describes how close the reflections)
  - high diffusion compared to room - reflections close together
  - sounds kind of flat
  - often have a filter to roll off the highs

### Prog Trance

* Find a loop, cut out interesting part
  - LFOTool to take out kick ("reverse sidechain")
  - Or put into a sampler (e.g. Battery 4)

* Battery 4 subliminal modulation.  Velocity changing
  - Volume
  - Tune
  - Cutoff

* Can use LFO tool hi-band cutoff to remove zero-crossing click (or leftover hats from samples)
