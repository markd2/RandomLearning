Picking samples from [DMP French house](https://www.dancemusicproduction.com/product/french-house/)
  - sample a short part that changes in pitch
  - ignore the bass, concentrae on the high frequency instruments
  - try to sample out of context of the original record
  - sample a little more than intended for the Stockhausen Effect


### Transients

1176 compressor on a rock drum. The FET tends to clamp donw and
distort the transient, adds punch, and brings snare to the front
of the mix.

Transient engery can move the sound forward (or back) in the mix
