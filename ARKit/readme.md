Prep for Clash 2022.

Reading _Mastering ARKit_ by Jayven Nhan (Apress)

## Matrices

4x4 matrices kind of important.

Addition is piecewise

|1 2 3|   |6 5 4|   |7 7 7|
|4 5 6| + |3 2 1| = |7 7 7|

(kind of a weird digression about matrices being arrays of arrays, and
swift + operator concatenatin rather than doing matrix math)

For an |x y z| vector
  - z axis points towards viewer
  - y points to the sky
  - x points to the right
