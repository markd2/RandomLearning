# Collision Detection

With my [Playdate](https://play.date) en-route, looking forward to programming
the little beastie.  Was watching the first (Shawn and Sean on Game Programming)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCtALewoFjc]
pvodcast from years ago (which is fascinating, and I've got enough old-school C
experiene to follow along with :alot: of it), Sean (or was it Shawn) mentioned
the book [Real Time Collision Detection](https://realtimecollisiondetection.net) by Christer Ericson, which is all about collision detection.  That's kind of necessary
in games.  So I'm going to read through that, make notes, and maybe try
out some algoriddims.  (I'm reading it through [O'Reilly Learning](https://www.oreilly.com) ~Safari~.  I'm a technical book junkie, so the platform is heaven for me.
