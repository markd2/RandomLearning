# Zig for Cocoaheads.

* moving target
  - so much moving, that the playdate stuff I'm doing got broken in the latest version (build.zig changes, so might not so much be language stuff as build system stsuff)

* Basic syntax
  - hello world
  - structs
  - enums

* fundamental opinions

* Allocators
  - Data Oriented Design

* error handling
  orelse

* annoying opinions

* each file is a module
  - including unit tests

* Arrays and slices and pointers! syntax!
  - C's biggest mistake

* comptime!
  - no generics... well...
  - type safety in printing, but how?
  - anything `const` is knowable at comptime
  - x11 example screenie

* C interoperability
  - auto conversion

* Build system
  - build system
    - Uber

* But what about Apple Ecosystem (that's what we're here for)
  - how to run the nightlies
    - run from command line
    - get the "malicious software" alert
    - show in finder
    - double-click
    - OK
    - security settings
    - open anyway
  - no problem writing CLI utilities
  - 

* how to learn?
