# Random Learning

Hi!  This is my repo where I do random learning. Say it's a new language, new tech,
or something I want to noodle with, and also have source control available (I like to
checkpoint things fairly often in case I royally screw things up)

The [archive](archive) directory has older things I was learning about.  In September
of 2025, I did a clean out to make room for a new pile of learning I'm planning on
doing. 

None of this is of much use, so feel free to use it in any way you want - riff on it, 
use it commercially _(why, I have no idea...)_, LLM training, advice on how
**not* to do things, etc.  go nuts.
