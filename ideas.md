# Ideas

various ideas of stuff I want to do once I have more time to devote to nerdy things.
Lists gathered with sattelite apps built on [Ephemeral ToDo](https://github.com/markd2/EphemeralToDo)

## App Ideas

Specific software I want to build.

* _Why Did I Wake Up?_ - my mac mini keeps waking up, especially overnight, which then
  light up half the house. Something that'll grovel logs and  figure out exactly why it
  keeps waking up.  (and it's not just the current mini, this has been an ongoing problem
  for **years**.  #ItJustWorks)
* Apps with tags
* spreadsheet
* Playdate Lua Game
* Playdate C / Swift-embedded game
* Overhaul [Borkle2](https://github.com/markd2/Borkle2) so it's more than just a
  mind-mapper, but more zettlekasten
* RideBuddy 2
* Foster Threshold test
* BP Visualizer (like that pre-32pocalypse one I really liked)
* Kitchen inventory
* Retro Benchmarker
* Mille Borks
* Voice controlled recipe assitant
* Apple 2 reference manual app
* Grafdemo for swiftui
* Laurel's metronome from hell
* Borkstitch
* quick (lock-screen) expense entry
* better top / activity monitor CPU thing
* 6502 Tearing assisting app (Enhancing your Apple 2 1st and second 2d, Don Lancaster)
* Galactica handheld game
* Correspondence tracker
* Infocom mapper helper
* Gameboy Emulator
* DrawSteel support
* Some kind of ICS helper
* Borkbot for twitch
* Story tracker (have I bored this person with this story before?)
* Recipe accumulator
* Photography diary
* area restaurant traxor (Lemme go and visit everybody and give my reviews. Maybe trace out an area on a map with a finger for "show me all the foodage in this region)
* create crostic from photo
* Swift Composable Architecture (TCA) visualizer (what are the reducers doing, etc)
* TIME BOXXY
* pipedream-style puzzle
* heart rate sequeince overlaid with exercise, choose where workout has ended to
  see your actual post-workout recovery rate, no matter where that happened.
* pipedream style puzzle
* MUST SAVE ROOMBA
* Unified ideas capturer
* High Friction recipe keeper (might do a whole line of High Friction software)
  - everything is too damn easy.  If you can scan, love with a tap, or ingest
    homoginized slop, then you might be hoarder.

* string animations in BASIC
* Tetris 
* Obligatory MadLibs
* Apple ][ Powerpoint
