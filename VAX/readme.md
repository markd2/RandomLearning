# Just the VAX, ma'am

Turns out the [Large Scale Systems Museum](https://www.lssmuseum.org) has working
VAXen with VMS.  And I want to do [More of the Same](https://github.com/markd2/MoreOfTheSame/)
with VAX assembly langauge, and maybe something like FORTRAN.

## Assembly

There's stuff in the (assembly)[assembly] subdirectory here.

## VMS

There's stuff in the (VMS Notes)[vms-notes.md] about non-code VMS stuff.
